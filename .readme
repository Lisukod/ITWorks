To use function call "addExpressions([[coefficient, exponent], ...], [[coefficient, exponent], ...])", it will return sum of provided expressions in form of string
Coefficient and exponent can be any of real numbers, positive and negative
If terms are not sorted or in one expression are multiple with same exponent program will handle it
Arrays of Polymonimals cannot be assignet to variable or object cause it may return unexpected outcome when used multiple times in function
Test syntax:
mainTest([[coefficient, exponent], ...], [[coefficient, exponent], ...], "Expected result", "Test name")
The "testName" is optional
